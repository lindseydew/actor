Growth Hacking at the Guardian

Over the past few months I have been part of a team that has been tasked with increasing our page views and unique visits to
[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com). With no commitment to deliver on any specific products, as a team we were free to design our work around
what we thought would make the biggest difference to traffic based on data analysis, previous results and discussions
around the office.

Some intiatives worked well. A simple hack which connected individual posts from our Guardian Facebook account
to traffic back to our site enabled our community coordinators to understand which facebook posts were successful. As a
result our facebook referred traffic has grown massively compared to before we started the project.

And then some things we tried didn't work so well.

But the specifics of what worked and what didn't for us won't be true for everyone, so here are some guiding principle for
anyone setting out to 'growth hack' or deliver software to change metrics.

**Know people that know your business** In our case this is production and curation of content, and these people can be the best growth hackers. A lot of our
successes were from initiatives that were a genuine partnership between our team and editorial. Sometimes this came down to
creating tools that enabled site editors to test hypotheses, sometimes this was making data visible and accessible to
show how content is performing and sometimes it was brainstorming ideas together about what would work on section fronts.
Technology won't produce good business results if made in isolation from the business.

**Measure Everything** Sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget about. Working out a measurement criteria upfront forces you
to understand what you hope to achieve with the initiative. Using the results of previous experiments can help guide you
to what you should try next, and also give you a sense of how much effort to put into trials in order to get results.

**Know your levers** A lot of this comes down to having good data analysis and breakdowns of the metric you're trying to
effect. When our team first formed we spent a lot of time analysing what makes up a days traffic, and slicing this by
referreral source, device accessed, geolocation of user. Small pots can indicate an opportunity, but may also mean there
isn't an appetite for this kind of content consumption.

**Park ideas** Not seeing immediate success? Is it fundamental idea, or was there a problem with the execution? Either
way, if you're not impacting on the metrics you set out to then it's probably worth trying another idea which might achieve
the same goal more easily. The freedom to drop ideas has the counter implication that you should be able to justify any
longer running project with some success indicators.
